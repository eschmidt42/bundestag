This may be particularly interesting for the upcoming election in 2021. E.g., if you want to see what your local member of the parliament has been up to in terms of public roll call votes relative to the parties, or how individual parties agree in their votes, this dataset may be interesting for you. \n",

    "Since the files on the bundestag website are stored in a way making it tricky to automatically crawl them, a bit of manual work is required to generate that dataset. But don't fret! Quite a few recent roll call votes (as of the publishing of this repo) are already prepared for you. But if older or more recent roll call votes are missing, convenience tools to reduce your manual effort are demonstrated below. An alternative route to get the same and more data (on politicians and local parliaments as well) is via the abgeordnetenwatch route.\n",
